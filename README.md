## Spam Detection using Naive Bayes
This project implements a simple and effective spam detection system using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and the Bag-of-Words model. It classifies messages as Spam or Ham based on their textual content.

## Key Features
Uses CountVectorizer for text vectorization

Trains a MultinomialNB model on a balanced dataset

Evaluates with accuracy and classification report

Displays a confusion matrix

Includes interactive spam prediction from user input

## Performance
Achieves high accuracy on test set (~95–98% depending on split)

Fast and lightweight – suitable for smaller applications
